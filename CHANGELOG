The design system for Proton projects is here. A quick look?

## Features of the Design System

- A global reference for design: colors, SVG icons available, buttons styles, etc.
- A documentation to share front-end best practices (conventions, DOs/DONTs, etc.)
- Some sets of re-usable classes (helpers) for front-end: typographic/hiding/etc. helpers, positionning helpers, etc.
- A mini Flexbox micro-framework for achieving most common positionning.
- To be notified of updates, a RSS is available.

## Goals

Here are goals of this tool:

- Having a more consistent experience for users
- Having a consistent reference for all the teams, and mutualizing some elements on all Proton projects in order to save time
- Improving/simplifying work discussions between design and devs, and between all front-end team (same language, same conventions, same objectives)
- Improving/simplifying Front-End maintenability/scalability, by not reinventing the wheel: the goal is to reduce drastically the CSS weight on PM V4 - target is to reduce it by half
- Facilitating the onboarding of newcomers in the team.

## Roadmap

This will be first the main place to implement design of the V4 of PM. Real assets will come quickly, and project will be updated on a regular basis.

In a near future, there will be other projects (click on the VPN icon to get a nice message)
